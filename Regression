Project Overview
In this hands-on project, we will develop a deep learning regression model to predict house prices in California. This project serves as an excellent introduction to regression problems in deep learning, demonstrating how neural networks can capture complex relationships in real estate data.

Dataset Description
We will work with the California Housing dataset, which contains information about houses in California districts:
Demographic Features:
   Median Income
  Population
Average Occupancy
Housing Features:
House Age
Average Rooms
